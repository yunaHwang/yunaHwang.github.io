APA citation: Bodden, C., Rakita, D., Mutlu, B., & Gleicher, M. (2016, August). Evaluating intent-expressive robot arm motion. *In 2016 25th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN)* (pp. 658-663). IEEE.

Four major contributions of this paper include:
<ul>
  <li>Provides insight of the effects of different kinematics (e.g., straight, simple, *legible*)</li>
  <li>Focuses mainly on the performance and quality of Human-Robot collaboration, differentiating from highlighting only the functional objectives (e.g., minimizing time, maximizing efficiency)</li>
  <li>Entails various evaluation metrics that measure both absolute and relative time (or path it took) for the user to correctly predict robot intent</li>
  <li>Guides future research to investigate factors that shape observer performance (e.g., participant's vantage point, robot degree-of-freedom)</li>
</ul>
