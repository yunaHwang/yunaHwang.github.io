<p align="justify">I am a Computer Science PhD student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am part of the <a href="https://peopleandrobots.wisc.edu/" target="_blank"  class="link_grey">People and Robots Laboratory</a> and am grateful to be advised by <a href="http://bilgemutlu.com/" target="_blank"  class="link_grey">Professor Bilge Mutlu</a>. My interests are Human-Robot Interaction and End-User Programming. More specifically, about building interactive robot programming systems that utilize natural language prompts. </p>

<p align="justify">I studied Artificial Intelligence and Statistics at <a href="https://www.skku.edu/eng/" target="_blank" class="link_grey">Sungkyunkwan University</a>, Seoul, South Korea for my undergraduate degrees.</p> <a href="https://hailab.skku.edu/people/current#h.dktub3ux3t9c" target="_blank" class="link_grey">Professor Hayeon Song</a>, affiliated with the <a href="https://hailab.skku.edu/hai-lab" target="_blank" class="link_grey">Human-AI Interaction Laboratory</a> led me to the field of Computer-Mediated Communication, and Human-Computer/Human-Robot Interaction.
